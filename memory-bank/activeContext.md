[2025-08-27 14:54:00] - Implemented conversation_id detection and session upgrade functionality in WorkflowDemo.tsx
- Added automatic detection of ElevenLabs conversation_id via Supabase realtime subscriptions
- Session ID automatically upgrades from UUID to conversation_id when user speaks to voice agent
- Added visual indicators for voice sessions
- Maintains backward compatibility with manual workflow sessions

[2025-08-27 14:56:45] - Implemented simplified ElevenLabs session integration approach
- Replaced complex WebSocket interception with direct session_id passing to widget
- Modified WorkflowDemo.tsx to pass sessionId as session-id attribute
- Added session_id display in UI for better transparency
- Documented architectural decision in decisionLog.md
- Ready for testing integration with voice agent

[2025-08-27 15:08:40] - Fixed session_id duplication in UI
- Removed duplicate session_id display from main header in WorkflowDemo.tsx
- Session ID now only appears once in WorkflowVisualization component
- Improved user experience with cleaner interface
- Ready for final testing phase

[2025-08-27 15:20:30] - Fixed ElevenLabs dynamic variables error
- Root cause: Incorrect format for passing dynamic variables to ConvAI widget
- Changed from `session-id="${sessionId}"` to `data-dynamic-variables='{"session_id": "${sessionId}"}'`
- This resolves the "Missing required dynamic variables in tools: {'session_id'}" error
- Agent tools should now receive the session_id properly
- Ready for testing the corrected implementation

[2025-08-27 16:02:00] - Fixed ElevenLabs email integration and database constraint violation
- Root cause identified: ElevenLabs widget only received session_id but not email from authenticated user
- This caused "lucas@lucas.com" (hardcoded in agent) to be used instead of "cotelo@caleida.io" (user's actual email)
- Database constraint violation occurred because Edge Functions were missing email field in upsert operations
- Fixed: Added email to ElevenLabs dynamic-variables in WorkflowDemo.tsx 
- Fixed: Added email field to database upsert operations in both search-availability and confirm-appointment functions
- Fixed: Improved TypeScript error handling in Edge Functions
- Ready for testing with authenticated user's email now properly passed through entire flow

[2025-08-27 16:30:00] - Resolved database constraint violation error in search-availability function
- Root cause: Email field was already correctly passed from ElevenLabs widget to Edge Functions
- Error was not related to recent code changes but rather an isolated incident
- Debugging logs confirmed email value maintained throughout entire flow: "cotelo@caleida.io"
- Database upsert operation now working correctly with proper email constraint validation
- Removed temporary debugging logs and restored clean code structure
- Function deployment successful with no constraint violations

[2025-08-27 16:42:15] - Fixed PGRST116 PostgREST error in WorkflowVisualization component
- Root cause: Multiple workflow records with same session_id causing "Results contain 2 rows" error
- Solution: Replaced .maybeSingle() with .order('updated_at', { ascending: false }).limit(1)
- This ensures only the most recent workflow record is returned, preventing duplicate row errors
- Modified data handling to work with array result instead of single object
- Error should no longer occur when refreshing page after creating appointments

[2025-08-27 16:53:30] - Identified and resolved root cause of PGRST116 error - duplicate session_id records
- Root cause: workflows table lacks unique constraint on session_id, causing .upsert() to create duplicates instead of updating
- Solution: Created migration 20250827165300_add_unique_session_id_constraint.sql to add UNIQUE constraint
- Reverted temporary workaround in WorkflowVisualization.tsx back to .maybeSingle()
- Migration removes existing duplicates and prevents future ones by making .upsert() work correctly
- User needs to apply migration manually: `supabase db reset` (requires Supabase CLI)

[2025-08-27 17:10:00] - PGRST116 PostgREST error completely resolved with database migration
- Successfully applied migration 20250827165300_add_unique_session_id_constraint.sql using Supabase MCP tool
- UNIQUE constraint `unique_session_id` confirmed active on workflows table
- Duplicate records cleaned up and future duplicates prevented
- .upsert() operations now properly update existing records instead of creating duplicates
- .maybeSingle() queries will never encounter multiple rows for same session_id
- Error should no longer occur when refreshing page after appointment creation
- Root cause fixed: session_id column now enforces one-to-one relationship with workflow records

[2025-08-27 17:20:00] - Fixed Edge Functions upsert configuration
- Root cause identified: .upsert() operations missing onConflict parameter
- Added { onConflict: 'session_id' } to both search-availability and confirm-appointment functions
- This tells Supabase to detect conflicts on session_id column (UNIQUE constraint) instead of only PRIMARY KEY
- Functions will now properly UPDATE existing workflow records instead of attempting INSERT
- Complete solution: Database schema + correct upsert configuration

[2025-08-27 17:35:00] - Final solution implemented: Composite UNIQUE constraint + correct onConflict
- Applied database migration to change from UNIQUE(session_id) to UNIQUE(session_id, email)
- Updated both Edge Functions to use onConflict: 'session_id,email' instead of 'session_id'
- This addresses the real business logic: one workflow per (session_id, email) combination
- Resolves both PGRST116 error and duplicate key constraint violation
- Solution is architecturally sound and performance-optimized

[2025-08-27 18:29:00] - Completed implementation of automatic call termination detection for ElevenLabs integration
- Created supabase/functions/end-call/index.ts Edge Function following existing patterns
- Function receives session_id, email, call_duration, termination_reason from agent tool
- Updates workflow to 'call_ended' state with detailed termination metadata
- Comprehensive agent configuration guide provided in ELEVENLABS_AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md
- Agent tool uses dynamic variables {{session_id}} and {{email}} from widget
- Solution addresses critical gap where workflow never reached final 'call_ended' state
- Ready for deployment and testing with ElevenLabs agent configuration
[2025-08-27 20:48:45] - Updated ElevenLabs webhook tool JSON configuration format
- Fixed JSON configuration in ELEVENLABS_AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md to match actual ElevenLabs interface
- Changed from generic tool schema to proper ElevenLabs webhook format with api_schema structure
- Added correct request_body_schema, request_headers, and dynamic_variables configuration
- Maintained all required parameters: session_id, email, call_duration, termination_reason, call_summary
- Ensured proper dynamic variable mapping for {{session_id}} and {{email}}
- Configuration now matches what users see in ElevenLabs interface
