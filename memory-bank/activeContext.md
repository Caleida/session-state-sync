[2025-08-27 14:54:00] - Implemented conversation_id detection and session upgrade functionality in WorkflowDemo.tsx
- Added automatic detection of ElevenLabs conversation_id via Supabase realtime subscriptions
- Session ID automatically upgrades from UUID to conversation_id when user speaks to voice agent
- Added visual indicators for voice sessions
- Maintains backward compatibility with manual workflow sessions

[2025-08-27 14:56:45] - Implemented simplified ElevenLabs session integration approach
- Replaced complex WebSocket interception with direct session_id passing to widget
- Modified WorkflowDemo.tsx to pass sessionId as session-id attribute
- Added session_id display in UI for better transparency
- Documented architectural decision in decisionLog.md
- Ready for testing integration with voice agent

[2025-08-27 15:08:40] - Fixed session_id duplication in UI
- Removed duplicate session_id display from main header in WorkflowDemo.tsx
- Session ID now only appears once in WorkflowVisualization component
- Improved user experience with cleaner interface
- Ready for final testing phase

[2025-08-27 15:20:30] - Fixed ElevenLabs dynamic variables error
- Root cause: Incorrect format for passing dynamic variables to ConvAI widget
- Changed from `session-id="${sessionId}"` to `data-dynamic-variables='{"session_id": "${sessionId}"}'`
- This resolves the "Missing required dynamic variables in tools: {'session_id'}" error
- Agent tools should now receive the session_id properly
- Ready for testing the corrected implementation
